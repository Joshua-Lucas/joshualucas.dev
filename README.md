# My Portfolio

This is a recreation of my portfolio using Next.js, Typescript and Styled-Components.

Here is my current portfolio which will remain up (https://joshualucasportfolio.herokuapp.com/)

The purpose of recreating my portfolio was to get practice the whole process of developing a website.

## My Process

#### Design:

---

- Used dribble and different websites from Next.js projects for inspiration.

- Determined color pallete and typography.

- Design each section of the page with Figma

#### Development:

---

- I pulled in a [Next Boilerplate](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript-eslint-jest) that had prettier,eslint,jest, and typescript configured and then i added styled-componets.

- Then developed and styled based on the design I created

- Using MongoDB to hold data and using serverless functions to retrieve that data.

#### Deploy:

---

- The plan is to host on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and add my domain name.
